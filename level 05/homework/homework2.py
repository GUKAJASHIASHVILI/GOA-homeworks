dog_name1 = "Rick"
dog_name2 = "Joh"
dog_name2 = "Max"

print("First dog's name is" + " " + dog_name1 + ". " + "Second dog's name is" + " " + dog_name2)


# 1. reassign

# 2. snake_case


# 1. In this code, dog_name2's name is reassigned from "Jhon" to "Max".


# 2. we need to use snake_case in this code, because we need to declare dog's name and we cant put space between them so we need to use snake_case and put "_"
